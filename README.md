# Credit-Card-Approval using Machine Learning
I Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).
# Objective:
This project aims to predict credit card approval using applicant features through data preprocessing, feature transformation, and machine learning model development to enhance prediction accuracy.
# Key highlights:
Analyzed credit card approval predictions by evaluating applicant attributes with multiple machine learning models to enhance accuracy.
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the dataset and compare variables, with feature selection based on statistical significance tests.
Applied various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, and Boosting.
Compared the performance of these algorithms to identify the most effective model for predicting credit card approval.
