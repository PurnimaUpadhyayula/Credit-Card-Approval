# Credit-Card-Approval using Machine Learning
I Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).
# Objective:
This project aims to predict credit card approval using applicant features through data preprocessing, feature transformation, and machine learning model development to enhance prediction accuracy.
# Key Highlights:
•	Analyzed credit card approval predictions by evaluating applicant attributes with multiple machine learning models to enhance accuracy.
•	Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the dataset and compare variables, with feature selection based on statistical significance tests.
•	Applied various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging, and Boosting.
•	Compared the performance of these algorithms to identify the most effective model for predicting credit card approval.
